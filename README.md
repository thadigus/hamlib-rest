# 📡 Hamlib REST API Server

### **This is not a client application.**

### A FastAPI-based authenticated REST wrapper for Hamlib rig control

Hamlib REST API is a Python based REST API for Hamlib, written with FastAPI, supporting both OpenAPI and Swagger. This project is written to make the Hamlib library more accessible for frontend web frameworks such as React. This also has a convient second function of becoming a server for multiple client front ends to connect and operate amatuer radio transcievers.

This project provides a fully authenticated **REST API** for controlling amateur radio equipment via **Hamlib**, with complete support for:

* Frequency control
* Mode/width control
* VFO selection
* Split operation
* Levels (RF power, mic gain, etc.)
* RIT/XIT
* PTT
* Repeater offset/shift
* Power state
* Configuration parameters

All rig commands are exposed as **REST endpoints**, and the server includes **session-based authentication**, **USB device discovery**, and **auto-generated OpenAPI documentation**.

# 🚀 Features

### ✔ Full Hamlib Capability Exposure

Every major rig control function is wrapped:

* get/set frequency
* get/set mode & filter width
* get/set VFO
* get/set split (mode, TX freq, TX VFO)
* get/set RIT and XIT
* get/set PTT
* get/set power
* get/set repeater settings
* get/set levels
* Hamlib configuration parameters

### ✔ Session-based Rig Instances

Each authenticated user session maintains its own rig object.
Multiple rigs / users can operate in parallel.

### ✔ Auto-Generated Swagger UI

To explore and interact with all rig commands.

# 🔧 Installation

### Docker Implementation (Recommended)

This project has been built from the ground up to run on Docker. You can simply build the container and run it, passing through whatever devices you would like, or handing it `--privileged`.

```bash
docker build -t hamlib-rest ./
docker run --privileged -p 8080:8080
```

Navigate to: <http://localhost:8080/docs>

### Development Container

For a repeatable local dev environment, the repo includes a `.devcontainer` setup that reuses the provided `Dockerfile`.

1. Install the **Dev Containers** (or **Remote Containers**) extension in VS Code.
2. From this folder run **“Dev Containers: Reopen in Container”** (or run `devcontainer up --workspace-folder .` from the CLI).
3. VS Code will build the container, mount the workspace at `/code`, and forward port `8080`.

Once inside the container you can use the built-in Python interpreter (`/usr/bin/python3`) and launch the API with `uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`.

#### USB serial devices inside the devcontainer

Hamlib needs direct access to USB serial devices. Dev Containers let you pass host devices into the container using per-user overrides so you do not have to commit machine-specific paths:

1. Copy `.devcontainer/devcontainer.local.json.example` to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.local.json` (this file is gitignored).
2. Edit the `runArgs` array to list each device you want to expose using the normal Docker `--device=/dev/ttyUSBx` syntax.
3. (Optional) Keep the `mounts` entry or point it at any other `/dev/serial/by-id/...` path you want so the familiar udev symlinks are available inside the container.
4. Rebuild/Reopen the devcontainer.

The Docker Engine must also be able to reach the device (e.g. on Linux the user running Docker needs to be in the `dialout` group). Once the container restarts, the ports you listed in `devcontainer.local.json` appear inside `/dev` and Hamlib can use them normally.

# 🔐 Authentication

This server uses simple session-based authentication.

1. Login to create a session:

```
POST /login
```

The server returns:

```json
{
  "session_id": "abcdef123456",
  "user": "..."
}
```

2. Use this `session_id` as a query parameter for all rig commands:

```
GET /rig/frequency?session_id=abcdef123456
```

Sessions also act as namespaces:
each session gets its own rig instance.

---

# ⚙️ Initialize the Rig

Before sending rig commands you must initialize it:

```
POST /rig/init?session_id=abcdef123456
```

Body:

```json
{
  "model": 229,
  "port": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
  "baud": 4800
}
```

Supports any Hamlib rig model number.
